class ChainingHashTable:
    """
    A chaining hash table. This data structure stores items by mapping each item
    to a location in an array. This data structure uses a hash function to
    compute the bucket index from the item's key.
    This type of hash table uses chaining to handle collisions.
    Each element in the hash table is called a bucket. Each bucket
    is a list of lists of items (key-value pairs).
    If the hash function returns a bucket index
    that is already occupied, the key-value pair is added to the occupied bucket
    at the next index.

    Adapted from  C950 - Webinar-1 - Letâ€™s Go Hashing.

    hash table

    between the size of the hashtable and the capacity of the hash table
