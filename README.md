# WGUPS Routing Program
## Overview
This project showcases the development of an efficient routing algorithm for the Western Governors University Parcel Service (WGUPS). The solution involves implementing non-linear data structures, hashing algorithms, and self-adjusting heuristics to ensure all packages are delivered on time while maintaining a total travel distance under 140 miles.

## Competencies
**Non-Linear Data Structures:** Developed efficient software using non-linear data structures.
- **Hashing Algorithms and Structures:** Implemented hashing techniques for efficient searching.
- **Self-Adjusting Heuristics:** Improved performance using self-adjusting heuristics.

## Introduction
This project focuses on solving routing problems for WGUPS by determining an efficient delivery route and distribution for daily local deliveries. It involves implementing algorithms to meet specific delivery constraints while maintaining a total travel distance under 140 miles.

## Scenario
WGUPS needs an efficient routing algorithm for their Salt Lake City DLD route, which has three trucks, two drivers, and an average of 40 packages to deliver daily. The project includes developing a hash table, lookup functions, and a delivery algorithm to ensure all packages are delivered on time.

## Requirements
### Development Tasks
**Hash Table**

Develop a hash table to insert package data including delivery address, deadline, city, zip code, weight, and status.

**Lookup Function**

Create a lookup function to retrieve package data using the package ID.

**Delivery Algorithm**

Implement an algorithm to deliver all packages under the given constraints.

### Interface and Validation
**User Interface**

Provide an interface to view the delivery status and total mileage traveled by all trucks

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of advanced algorithms and data structures to solve real-world routing problems, showcasing skills in efficient coding, problem-solving, and professional communication.
